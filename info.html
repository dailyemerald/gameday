	<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

	<strong>How we collect and use personal information</strong><br>
	<p>We keep track of how individual users experience our mobile app: What pages they view, how many stories they view, how long they stay, how often they come back.  We collect that information anonymously but the data is associated with a specific mobile device. That information is stored by a third-party analytics service. We do share that anonymous information with third parties, including sponsors of the app, to help improve the performance of the mobile experience. We do collect a users IP addresses when they accesses the app. That IP address can provide information about a user’s general location. But we cannot and do not connect that data with the names, addresses or birth dates of individual users. We will store the anonymous data as long as the app is active. We use industry practices to protect the security of our users’ data.</p>

	<p>We may change the privacy policy in the future and will provide users’ notification of material changes, including the collection, sharing or storing of users personal information.</p>

	<p>We do not view, store or share your precise location.
	We do not currently keep track of users’ real-time precise location. Nor do we store or share that information.</p>

	Advertising<br>
	<p>We have third-party sponsors of the mobile app but we do not collect users’ personal data to specifically target advertising. We do use anonymous data to help sponsors provide more relevant advertising based on how uses experience the app.</p>

	Automatic Data Collection and Advertising<br>
	<p>This section is intended to address applications that are ad supported. The MMA provides model language to address situations where a third party ad network obtains data for the purpose of ad targeting.</p>


	How the “Feed” works<br>
	<p>The “Feed” collects tweets and Instagram photos from users who are part of the Oregon football community. Here’s where the information comes from: Tweets and Instagram photos that are public, have been enabled by the user for geotagging and are submitted in or around Autzen Stadium or the surrounding area.; and tweets and Instagram photos that are public and include “#GoDucks”; and tweets that are public and relevant to Oregon football. We do not collect any information through the Feed that is not already made public by the user who created the tweets or Instagram photos.</p>

	Opt-out rights
	Users can opt out of any data collection by uninstalling the app.

	Children
	We do not solicit information or market to children under the age of 13.
